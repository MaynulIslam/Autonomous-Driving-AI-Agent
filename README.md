# Autonomous-Driving-AI-Agent
Develop an AI-based driver assistance system that uses machine learning models to detect objects, make driving decisions, and predict traffic patterns in real-time.

**Technologies:** Computer Vision, Sensor Fusion (LiDAR, cameras), Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks (e.g., CNNs for image processing)
**Goals:** Create a prototype that can classify objects (vehicles, pedestrians, road signs) and make driving decisions (lane change, speed adjustment).

**Milestones:**
1. Collect and preprocess road traffic data.
2. Train a CNN model to classify road objects.
3. Implement decision-making logic using Reinforcement Learning.
4. Simulate driving decisions using a framework like CARLA (Car Learning to Act) or OpenAI Gym.
